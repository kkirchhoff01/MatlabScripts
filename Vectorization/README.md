This is a collection of scripts that I wrote for my MATH 581 final project on vectorization in MATLAB. The project was a research paper which analyzed efficiency of parallel processing and vectorization. I used the KU ACF cluster to run these and the results were very interesting. I analyzed both CPU and GPU distributed computations. Most involved matrix/vector operations including multiplication and LU factorization. I didn't bother to comment the scripts because they were each only used within one sitting.
